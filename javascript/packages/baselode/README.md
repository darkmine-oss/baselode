# BASELODE

## Free Tooling for the Exploration and Mining Industry

`baselode` is a free software project developed by Darkmine Pty Ltd.

`baselode` is designed to support the exploration and mining industry, with an ever-growing suite of tools that enable data loading, data modeling, visualization, and common algorithms in one package that can be imported and leveraged without extensive customisation requirements (but is infinitely customizable).
